Quick Legal Services
A common myth about lawyers is that you
only need one when you run into trouble
with the law. This is far from the truth as
lawyers have proven to be quite useful in
most of our everyday transactions. At
MCMCo, we have packaged these into
"Quick Legal Services"
. Our quick legal
services are tailored to cater to specific
everyday transactions that may require
you to hire a lawyer. Aside from offering
you a quality service, you're assured of
efficiency and affordability with our quick
legal services.

3. Debt - Collection
   Have you run out of patience with a
   business or individual that owes you
   money?

You may have hired a debt collection
agency in the past to collect your overdue
bills, to no avail. Such agencies don
â€™t convey
the formality of the situation. But when you
hire a lawyer to collect your debt, not only
are lawyers more affordable than debt
collection companies, it also boosts the
urgency and formality of the situation to
your debtors, who are more likely to sit up
and take notice when threatened with legal
action. Not only can we put pressure on the
debtors, but in many cases we can obtain
money from them against their will, such as
executing a bank levy on known accounts
or possession order on property.
